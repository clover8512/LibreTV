# LibreTV â€” Frontend (React + TypeScript)

This branch (refactor/frontend-react-ts) contains a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend scaffold.
The backend remains unchanged in the repository root.

Quick start:
1. cd to the repository root
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- The scaffold is isolated under src/
- You'll need to wire API calls to the existing backend routes (CORS/proxy may be required during dev)
- I can push the scaffold to the branch and open a PR for review
